# preliminary README (missing the why and the context)

If you have no openvirtuoso server you can launch this container in server mode by running:

docker run -d -p 8890:8890 -p 1111:1111 --name virtuoso_server virtuoso_log_grabber server

You run the log grabber to connect to a virtuoso instance running in a docker container like this:

	docker run -i -t --link <containername>:virtuoso --name grabber virtuoso_log_grabber

Or with any virtuoso server like this

	docker run -i -t -E="" -E=""  --name grabber virtuoso_log_grabber

This set's up the container. To actually grab the logs you rerun the container when needed:

	docker start -a grabber

Each time it runs it will output a new list of quads in the following format

A <s> <p> <o> <g>
A <s> <p> <o> <g>
D <s> <p> <o> <g>
# current position: 500

Make sure to set CheckpointAuditTrail=1 in the ini or else your transaction files will be emptied before the grabber might see them.

The container maintains the location in the log. So after removing the container you need to initialize it with
the starting point

# things to test and do

 - blank nodes
 - multiple trx files (after checkpointing has been run)
 - offsets with multiple trx files (is the offset global or file specific. How to handle the offset after a checkpoint has run. What if multiple checkpoints have run in between grabs)
 - strange characters in literals or hyperlinks. How to handle spaces.
